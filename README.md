# Idea

-  The idea is to provide out of the box solution for a developer to provide an environment with deliberate interruptions and latency in the system.
-  We will provide UI to the user to control the environment in real-time.

If this works, this will help users to test their existing environments easily without any modifications.

This will require working in `Python` and `Javascript` (`AngularJS`) intensively. Please contact `prat0318@gmail.com` for more details.
